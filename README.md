## Analysis
The World’s Real Estate Data shows that property prices are heavily influenced by factors such as location, building age, and apartment size. Urban areas generally have higher prices compared to rural regions, with prices escalating for newer buildings built post-2000 due to modern features and construction standards. Apartments on higher floors are typically more expensive due to better views and perceived prestige. Larger apartments, with more rooms, bedrooms, and bathrooms, also tend to demand higher prices. Overall, the price in USD varies significantly depending on the combination of these factors, with larger, newer, and better-located apartments generally commanding the highest prices.
